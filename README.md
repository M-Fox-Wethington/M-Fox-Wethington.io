## About Me

As an Environmental Data Scientist and PhD Candidate in Ecology and Evolution at Stony Brook University, my work resides at the dynamic intersection of ecology, geospatial analysis, and data science, with a specialized focus on understanding Antarctic ecosystems. My academic and research endeavors are anchored in the Lynch Lab for Quantitative Ecology, where I am dedicated to pioneering new methodologies for acquiring environmental and ecological data. My goal is to leverage these insights to unravel the complex realities of climate change in Antarctica and to communicate these discoveries effectively to drive meaningful change.

In pursuit of these objectives, my research methodology is diverse and innovative, encompassing the utilization of remotely-piloted aircraft systems (drones), Earth orbiting satellites, and advanced machine learning techniques. This multi-faceted approach allows me to delve deep into the interactions between Antarctic predators and their environments, exploring how environmental factors influence animal behaviors, migration patterns, and overall health over time. A significant aspect of my work focuses on the correlation between multi-decadal sea ice declines and the consequential impacts on penguin populations across Antarctica. By integrating these various technologies and analytical methods, my aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of ecosystem dynamics in the face of climate change, contributing valuable insights towards global ecological conservation efforts.

## Current Research Initiatives

In the forefront of my current research initiatives is the development of sophisticated computational pipelines designed to meticulously process and analyze ecological and geospatial data. At the heart of these efforts is the application of Machine Learning techniques, aimed at deepening our understanding of the nuanced impacts of climate change on Antarctic wildlife. This endeavor is not only about predicting future changes but also about crafting models that can offer insights into the complex interplay between environmental variables and animal behaviors.

A pivotal component of my work involves constructing a multi-decadal assessment of winter sea ice conditions around the Antarctic Peninsula. This assessment leverages data from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMI) and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) Unified datasets. Through this analysis, I aim to elucidate the long-term trends and variations in sea ice coverage and thickness, providing a critical context for understanding the ecological shifts affecting Antarctic species. The integration of these satellite-based observations with Machine Learning models enables a more nuanced exploration of how these environmental changes correlate with shifts in wildlife populations and distributions.

This research not only contributes to our scientific understanding of Antarctic ecosystems but also plays a crucial role in informing conservation strategies and policy decisions aimed at mitigating the impacts of climate change on vulnerable polar species.

## Past Projects

As an Environmental Data Scientist and PhD Candidate in Ecology and Evolution at Stony Brook University, I bridge the gap between ecology, geospatial science, and data analytics. My focus is on Antarctic ecosystems, where I study the delicate interplay between indigenous species and their changing environment.
